			<p>Chewsr is an app that helps a user explore the many different type of food places nearby when you get tired of the same, usual, common place. Chewsr has a wide spectrum of places of choose from and all at very close local range. Directions are very simple. First tell the app you general location or the location you want to get food at. Then adjust the range of radius the app will pick up. After that choose the type of food you are craving adn it will randomize your choices within that range you are looking for. If you ever get stuck deciding what to eat there is always the "I'm feeling Adventurous" button, where it will place you at a roulette of any kind of food place nearby. Now go and have fun trying out the many different typees of food your community has to offer.</p>
